# django-crud-concept

Trying different things while learning Django.

I found myself writing the same code but changing a model only for CRUD options in my application, I have a list of settings each with a model representation in the DB. 
I have no idea the best way to explain this, but I feel that by what I have done to reduce the code duplication has made it too obfuscated if I was to revisit it in 5 years time.
